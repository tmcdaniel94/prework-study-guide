 # <Prework Study Guide Webpage for University of Texas' Fullstack Bootcamp>

## Description

This prework study guide was created with the intention of recording important notes and reminders throughout the beginning modules of UT's Fullstack Bootcamp course. It was built by following along with the course's beginning prework content, which introduced the building blocks of this guide. The idea of the project is to take the first steps in building repositories on GitHub, as well as utilize Git and introduce HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts. It demonstrates my first steps into the journey of my own web development career.

## Usage

This study guide is meant to be used as a catalogue of notes for certain topics, such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, etc. You can view the JavaScript components in action (and to help decide what to study first!) by opening the Console tab in Chrome DevTools.
